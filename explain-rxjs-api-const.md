# Explain rxjs API Const

## RxJS is an integral part of many Angular applications, providing powerful tools for dealing with asynchronous operations and event-based programs using observable sequences. Among the many features of RxJS are special constant observables like `EMPTY` and `NEVER`. These constants offer specific behaviors that can be useful in various scenarios.

### 1. **EMPTY**
    - **Explanation**: An observable that emits no items and completes immediately.
    - **Use-case**: When you need an observable that doesn't produce any values and just completes. For instance, in an NgRx effect where you don't want to return any further action after certain actions.
    ```typescript
    import { EMPTY } from 'rxjs';

    someFunction(): Observable<any> {
      if (someCondition) {
        return EMPTY;
      }
      // ... other logic
    }

    // Or in an NgRx effect:

    loadSomething$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(someActionType),
      mergeMap(() => {
        if (someCondition) {
          return EMPTY;
        }
        return this.someService.fetchData();
      })
    ));
    ```

### 2. **NEVER**
    - **Explanation**: An observable that emits no items and does not complete.
    - **Use-case**: When you need an observable that remains open indefinitely and doesn't emit any values. It can be useful as a placeholder or to delay the completion of an observable sequence.
    ```typescript
    import { NEVER } from 'rxjs';
    import { startWith, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

    fetchData(): Observable<any> {
      return this.http.get('/api/data').pipe(
        startWith(NEVER),  // Wait indefinitely before the HTTP request completes or errors
        catchError(err => {
          console.error(err);
          return NEVER; // On error, don't complete the observable
        })
      );
    }
    ```

These constants, `EMPTY` and `NEVER`, can be thought of as special types of observables with well-defined behaviors. `EMPTY` is essentially a shorthand for `of().pipe(complete())`, and `NEVER` is an observable that neither emits a value nor completes, making it effectively "silent". These constants can be used in various situations where you need specific behaviors in your observables.
